The government was opening the economy under Deng Xiaoping, but also keeping a tight control over politics. This mix created a generation of students who saw a notable disconnect—they were being exposed to new ideas while still facing old restrictions. The 1978 \"Democracy Wall\" movement, discussed below, shows the ways in which people were starting to push political and social boundaries."},{"type":"text","value":"When reform-minded leader Hu Yaobang died in April 1989, students gathered to mourn him—this quickly grew into something much larger. The exhibit shows how within weeks, thousands of people—not just students, but workers and regular citizens too—packed the square demanding free press, a crackdown on corruption, and more influence over their government’s actions."},{"type":"text","value":"Through photos and descriptions of important events leading up to the massacre, we'll see how the peaceful protests evolved, including the dramatic hunger strikes that captured global attention.

That summer of 1989 became a fork in the road—the government doubled down on opening markets while tightening its grip on political expression. This strange balancing act, what officials call \"socialism with Chinese characteristics,\" has guided China's path ever since. The China that emerged looks nothing like what came before. The economic boom that followed created vast wealth alongside new social tensions, while the political climate stabilized in ways that continue to effect Chinese society today."}]},{"Type":"Highlight","marginTop":"true","marginBottom":"true","texts":[{"type":"Transition","value":"Initial sparks of dissent in the late 1970s set in motion a decade of reform and resistance, leading to the Tiananmen uprising."}]},{"Type":"Section","marginTop":"true","Title":"Years Before the Incident (1978–1988)","texts":[{"type":"text","value":"1978–1979 — Democracy Wall Movement: In the wake of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a pro-democracy group publicly emerged.

Reformist CCP General Secretary Hu Yaobang was seen as too lenient toward the protests; Deng Xiaoping deemed him “overly liberal.” In January 1987, Hu was forced to resign. This removal of a popular reformer had lasting consequences — students later hailed Hu as a symbol of political openness, and many 1986 protesters became leaders in 1989. Hu’s dismissal deepened a rift between reformists and hardliners in the Party."},{"type":"text","value":"Late 1980s — Economic Reform and Rising Discontent: Throughout the 1980s, China’s economic “Reform and Opening” brought rapid growth but also social strain. By 1988, rising inflation and even more blatant official corruption continued to fuel public resentment. Many urban Chinese — especially intellectuals and students — felt that economic change had outpaced political reform. Calls for “socialist democracy” grew louder in elite circles, and even within the Party some leaders acknowledged the need for political modernization. Yet conservative elders warned that liberalization threatened one-party rule. This tension set the stage for the confrontations to come."},{"type":"text","value":"Early 1989 — Intellectuals Petition for Reforms: In January 1989, renowned Chinese physicist Fang Lizhi wrote an open letter to Deng Xiaoping urging the release of political prisoners such as Wei Jingsheng. Fang’s bold appeal — unprecedented for a CCP member — emboldened many intellectuals, who followed with their own open letters pressing for human rights and democratic reforms. Though unofficial, this intellectual outcry signaled growing frustration with the Party’s hard line. When Hu Yaobang died suddenly in April 1989, years of pent-up demands for change would finally coalesce into a mass movement."}]},{"Type":"Image","url":"images/Xidan-Democracy-Wall.jpg","alt":"Students reading big-character posters on the Democracy Wall, 1978","caption":"Democracy Wall Movement, Beijing, 1978.

Over the following week, spontaneous memorials spread to campuses nationwide.

Yet their courage endures as a reminder that meaningful modernization requires not just material progress but also a respect for human rights and a willingness to engage in open dialogue. As China continues to expand its global economic and political influence, recalling the events of 1989 reminds us that sustainable progress cannot ignore the fundamental rights and aspirations of its people."}]},{"Type":"Section","Title":"References","texts":[{"type":"text","value":"• Mühlhahn, Klaus.
